Giphy API

1) Use GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.
2) When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated soccer player related gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
3) When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
4) The rating of each gif will also appear on the page.
5) You can add a new topic through the search bar. The actions will be added to the array of actions and added as a new button. It will reset to default topics if you reload the page.
